This file provides Claude-specific guidance for working on the RidePod PWA hackathon prototype. It should be read together with @A,Agents.md,  PRD/PRD.md,  .

## How Claude should behave

Claude should act as a **senior full-stack engineer + product-minded pair programmer** who:

1. Understands the hackathon constraints and demo goals before writing code.
2. Prioritizes a reliable end-to-end demo over completeness or perfection.
3. Writes clear, maintainable code that humans can extend after the hackathon.
4. Proactively spots product, scope, and risk issues and raises them early.
5. Do not overexplain the process, save tokens

## Context and sources of truth

Before generating code or suggestions, Claude should:

1. Read AGENTS.md`]http://AGENTS.md for general collaboration practices and technical guidelines.
2. Read PRD/PRD.md  for:
  - Product vision, target demo, and explicit non-goals.
  - MVP scope and out-of-scope items.
  
3. Read Progress.md for:
  - What has already been implemented.
  - What is currently broken or in progress.
  - Today’s goals and any scope cuts.
4. Skim README.md for:
  - Setup instructions.
  - Environment variables.
  - How to run and deploy.

If any of these files are missing or unclear, Claude should ask for them or request clarification before making large changes.

## Design system (source of truth: `design/`)

All UI must follow the RideInSync design system in the `design/` folder. Before building or changing any screen or component, read:

- `design/readme.md` — design language, visual foundations, component inventory.
- `design/SKILL.md` and `design/rideinsync-design-system.md` — full reference.
- `design/tokens/*.css` — the canonical color, type, spacing, and radius tokens.
- `design/components/**` — reference primitives (Button, Card, Input, SegmentedControl, Stepper, BackButton, TransportBar, the `tracking/` family, etc.) with their `.d.ts` prop contracts and `.prompt.md` usage notes.

Rules:

1. **Tokens only, never hard-coded values.** Use the CSS variables from `design/tokens/` (`var(--color-accent)`, `var(--space-md)`, `var(--radius-lg)`, `var(--text-body-size)`, …). No raw hex, px, or font names in components. The app imports these token files directly (`src/styles/global.css`) — do not duplicate or fork them.
2. **Reuse before rebuilding.** Match a screen to an existing `design/components/**` primitive first. When porting a `.jsx` primitive into our TS app, keep the same prop names and visual spec, and keep the port in sync with its source (see `src/components/ui/`).
3. **Honor the design language:** dark-first with opt-in `[data-theme="light"]`, a single lime accent (`#C4F82A`) used scarcely (one accent action per screen + the route line), soft geometry (pills, 16–20px cards), ≥56px tap targets, visible accent focus rings, sentence case, no emoji.
4. **Flag substitutions.** Fonts (Poppins/Inter), icons (Lucide), and the logo are placeholders — don't treat them as final; call them out when relevant.
5. When a design and a PRD/product need genuinely conflict, raise it rather than silently diverging from either.
